# NM
NM (Neural Module). It is a scheme for the mindustry game. It is a tool for simulation and training of neural networks (yes, right in the game). 
NM has its own request-response language, thanks to which you can manage and configure NM. NM uses the Forward-Forward algorithm (presented by Jeffrey Hinton, at the NeurIPS 2022 conference)
